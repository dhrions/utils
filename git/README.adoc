=== RÃ©daction des commits
When writing a commit message in Git, it is recommended to start the sentence with an imperative verb in the present tense. Some common verbs used in commit messages include:

* Add: for adding new features or files
* Update: for updating existing features or files
* Fix: for fixing bugs or errors
* Refactor: for making code improvements without changing functionality
* Remove: for removing features or files
* Improve: for improving existing features or functionality
* Doc: for updating documentation
* Test: for adding or updating tests

Starting the sentence with a verb in the imperative mood makes the commit message more clear and actionable. It also helps to keep the commit messages concise and consistent.
