Antora classifies the source files stored in a pages directory as pages. Pages are structured as individual documents with a title, marked up using the AsciiDoc syntax, and saved with the .adoc file extension. Using a pageâ€™s resource ID, you can cross reference a page from other pages, resources, or navigation files in your site or include a page into other pages or resources in your site.
